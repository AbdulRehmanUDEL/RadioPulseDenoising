# Test Data

This folder contains data for testing the trained networks.

* **PureSignals**: These are simulated waveforms generated using the CoREAS software, with no added noise.
* **SigPlusNoise**: These waveforms are a combination of CoREAS simulations and measured radio noise from the IceTop enhancement prototype station's antenna.

Both waveform sets have been processed and filtered within the **[70 - 350] MHz** band.
