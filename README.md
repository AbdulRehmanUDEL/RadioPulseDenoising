# RadioPulseDenoising

This repository contains scripts used for the construction and training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that are used for the classification and denoising of radio pulses from cosmic-ray air showers.


## DataReshapingForNetworks:

This notebook can be used to preprocess the data (reshape waveforms from two channels as a single sample) that can then be used for training of networks. Splitting into training and test sets can also be done within this script.
